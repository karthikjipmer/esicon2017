 abstract = {Hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder of bone mineralization caused due to defects (inherited/acquired) in the renal handling of phosphorus. This group includes varied conditions, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets being the most common inheritable form of rickets. The other common forms are autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia. Although these conditions exhibit different etiologies, increased phosphatonins form a common link among them. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the most widely studied phosphatonin. Genetic studies tend to show that the phosphorus homeostasis depends on a complex osteo-renal axis, whose mechanisms have been poorly understood so far. Newer disorders are being added as the mechanisms in this axis get discovered. This review focuses on the clinical, biochemical, genetic features and management of hypophosphatemic disorders leading to defective mineralization.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) caused by mutations in the PHEX gene is considered to be the most frequent cause of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-related congenital hypophosphatemic rickets. In previous studies, mutations in the PHEX gene were detected in 60-70{\%} of patients with clinical diagnoses of XLHR. This leads to the question whether current screening methods for mutations in the PHEX gene are inadequate or whether there is a substantial number of patients with other genetic causes of hypophosphatemic rickets. We conducted a genetic analysis of patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets to clarify their etiology and evaluate the prevalence of XLHR among this group.

DESIGN AND METHODS

We studied 27 patients with familial and sporadic congenital hypophosphatemic rickets in whom serum FGF23 was above 30 pg/ml using an assay for the full-length protein. Exons and exon-intron junctions of genomic DNA of causative genes for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets were sequenced. PHEX mRNA from peripheral blood was analyzed in some patients.

RESULTS

Direct sequencing of genomic DNA identified 11 novel and four known mutations in the PHEX gene. Additionally, there was a large PHEX gene deletion in one case and abnormal PHEX mRNA splicing in another. In summary, 26 patients (96{\%}) had XLHR and one patient had autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets 2.

CONCLUSIONS

XLHR is by far the most prevalent cause of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. We propose that analysis of PHEX mRNA from peripheral blood would be appropriate for the first screening step in determining the etiology of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is the most common form of inheritable rickets. Rickets treatment is monitored by assessing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, clinical features, and radiographs. Our objectives were to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of XLH and to assess correlations with disease activity.

STUDY DESIGN

Twenty-seven XLH patients (median age 9.2 years) were included in this prospective single-center observational study. XLH activity was assessed using height, leg bowing, dental abscess history, and serum ALP levels. We looked for correlations between MRI features and markers of disease activity.

RESULTS

On MRI, the median maximum width of the physis was 5.6 mm (range 4.8-7.8; normal {\textless}1.5), being {\textgreater}1.5 mm in all of the patients. The appearance of the zone of provisional calcification was abnormal on 21 MRI images (78{\%}), Harris lines were present on 24 (89{\%}), and bone marrow signal abnormalities were present on 16 (59{\%}). ALP levels correlated with the maximum physeal widening and with the transverse extent of the widening.

CONCLUSIONS

MRI of the knee provides precise rickets patterns that are correlated with ALP, an established biochemical marker of the disease, avoiding X-ray exposure and providing surrogate quantitative markers of disease activity.},

 abstract = {In children, hypophosphatemic rickets (HR) is revealed by delayed walking, waddling gait, leg bowing, enlarged cartilages, bone pain, craniostenosis, spontaneous dental abscesses, and growth failure. If undiagnosed during childhood, patients with hypophosphatemia present with bone and/or joint pain, fractures, mineralization defects such as osteomalacia, entesopathy, severe dental anomalies, hearing loss, and fatigue. Healing rickets is the initial endpoint of treatment in children. Therapy aims at counteracting consequences of FGF23 excess, i.e. oral phosphorus supplementation with multiple daily intakes to compensate for renal phosphate wasting and active vitamin D analogs (alfacalcidol or calcitriol) to counter the 1,25-diOH-vitamin D deficiency. Corrective surgeries for residual leg bowing at the end of growth are occasionally performed. In absence of consensus regarding indications of the treatment in adults, it is generally accepted that medical treatment should be reinitiated (or maintained) in symptomatic patients to reduce pain, which may be due to bone microfractures and/or osteomalacia. In addition to the conventional treatment, optimal care of symptomatic patients requires pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of pain and joint stiffness, through appropriated rehabilitation. Much attention should be given to the dental and periodontal manifestations of HR. Besides vitamin D analogs and phosphate supplements that improve tooth mineralization, rigorous oral hygiene, active endodontic treatment of root abscesses and preventive protection of teeth surfaces are recommended. Current outcomes of this therapy are still not optimal, and therapies targeting the pathophysiology of the disease, i.e. FGF23 excess, are desirable. In this review, medical, dental, surgical, and contributions of various expertises to the treatment of HR are described, with an effort to highlight the importance of coordinated care.},

@article{Ma.2015,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Hypophosphatemic rickets (HR) is a heterogeneous genetic phosphate wasting disorder. The disease is most commonly caused by mutations in the PHEX gene located on the X-chromosome or by mutations in CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3. The aims of this study were to perform molecular diagnostics for four patients with HR of Indian origin (two independent families) and to describe their clinical features.

METHODS

We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) for the affected mother of two boys who also displayed the typical features of HR, including bone malformations and phosphate wasting. B-lymphoblast cell lines were established by EBV transformation and subsequent RT-PCR to investigate an uncommon splice site variant found by WES. An in silico analysis was done to obtain accurate nucleotide frequency occurrences of consensus splice positions other than the canonical sites of all human exons. Additionally, we applied direct Sanger sequencing for all exons and exon/intron boundaries of the PHEX gene for an affected girl from an independent second Indian family.

RESULTS

WES revealed a novel PHEX splice acceptor mutation in intron 9 (c.1080-3C{\textgreater}A) in a family with 3 affected individuals with HR. The effect on splicing of this mutation was further investigated by RT-PCR using RNA obtained from a patient's EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell line. RT-PCR revealed an aberrant splice transcript skipping exons 10-14 which was not observed in control samples, confirming the diagnosis of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemia (XLH). The in silico analysis of all human splice sites adjacent to all 327,293 exons across 81,814 transcripts among 20,345 human genes revealed that cytosine is, with 64.3{\%}, the most frequent nucleobase at the minus 3 splice acceptor position, followed by thymidine with 28.7{\%}, adenine with 6.3{\%}, and guanine with 0.8{\%}. We generated frequency tables and pictograms for the extended donor and acceptor splice consensus regions by analyzing all human exons. Direct Sanger sequencing of all PHEX exons in a sporadic case with HR from the Indian subcontinent revealed an additional novel PHEX mutation (c.1211{\_}1215delACAAAinsTTTACAT, p.Asp404Valfs*5, de novo) located in exon 11.

CONCLUSIONS

Mutation analyses revealed two novel mutations and helped to confirm the clinical diagnoses of XLH in two families from India. WES helped to analyze all genes implicated in the underlying disease complex. Mutations at splice positions other than the canonical key sites need further functional investigation to support the assertion of pathogenicity.},

@article{Penido.2014,
 abstract = {The common denominator for all types of rickets is hypophosphatemia, leading to inadequate supply of the mineral to the growing bone. Hypophosphatemia can result from insufficient uptake of the mineral from the gut or its disproportionate losses in the kidney, the latter being caused by either tubular abnormalities per se or the effect on the tubule of circulating factors like fibroblast growth factor-23 and parathyroid hormone (PTH). High serum levels of the latter result in most cases from abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism which lead to decreased calcium absorption in the gut and hypocalcemia, triggering PTH secretion. Rickets is a disorder of the growth plate and hence pediatric by definition. However, it is important to recognize that the effect of hypophosphatemia on other parts of the skeleton results in osteomalacia in both children and adults.

@article{Qiu.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common form of heritable rickets characterized by X-linked dominant inheritance, renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and defective bone mineralization. Inactivating mutations of the PHEX gene located at Xp22.1 have been linked with this disease. Ethnic distribution of such mutations seems widespread but only a few mutations in the Chinese population have been reported to date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We report on a large Han Chinese family affected with XLH rickets, which included 13 patients from four generations. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were performed for all exons and intron-exon boundaries of the PHEX gene. The effect of nucleotide changes was analyzed using bioinformatic software. Prenatal diagnosis was performed on umbilical cord blood at the 20th gestational week.

RESULTS

A novel G--{\textgreater}A splice mutation in intron 7 (c.849+1G{\textgreater}A) was identified in all patients from the family. As confirmed by reverse-transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the mutation has rendered loss of a normal splice donor site (c.849+1G) while activating a cryptic one at c.849+519G, which resulted in addition of 518 nucleotides to the mature RNA. Prenatal diagnosis had excluded the fetus for carrying the same mutation. A healthy boy was born later.

CONCLUSIONS

A novel splice mutation c.849+1G{\textgreater}A in the PHEX gene is responsible for XLH in the studied family. Further studies may enhance our understanding of the role of this mutation in the pathogenesis of XLH.},

@article{Jadhav.2014,
 abstract = {CONTEXT

Tumor-induced osteomalacia is curable if the tumors can be totally excised. However, when the tumors are present in locations that make surgery disproportionately risky, the need for less invasive strategies like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is realized.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

We describe three patients with suspected tumor-induced osteomalacia who were treated in our department between 2006 and 2013 with tumors in surgically difficult locations and were subjected to single or multiple sessions of RFA. The response was documented in terms of symptomatic improvement, phosphorus normalization, and follow-up (99m)Technitium-labelled hydrazinonicotinyl-Tyr3-octreotide ((99m)Tc HYNIC TOC) scan.

RESULTS

Two of the three individuals, patient A (with a 1.5 $\times$ 1.2-cm lesion in the head of the right femur) and patient B (with a 1.3 $\times$ 1.2-cm lesion on the endosteal surface of the shaft of the left femur), achieved complete remission with single sessions of RFA. Three months after the procedure, (99m)Tc HYNIC TOC scans revealed the absence of uptake at the previous sites, corroborating with the clinical improvement and phosphorus normalization. Patient C had a large 5.6 $\times$ 6.5-cm complex lesion in the lower end of the left femur with irregular margins, loculations, and bone grafts placed in previous surgery. He failed to achieve remission after multiple sessions of RFA due to the complex nature of the lesion, although the tumor burden was reduced significantly as documented on serial (99m)Tc HYNIC TOC scans.

CONCLUSIONS

Although surgery remains the treatment of choice, RFA could be an effective, less invasive, and safe modality of treatment in judiciously selected patients.},

Twenty-five to 40{\%} of patients with well-controlled X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) have a final height under -2 SDS. Previous studies have shown that recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment improves linear growth in short children with XLHR.

OBJECTIVE

We studied the effectiveness of rhGH treatment in children with XLHR in a larger cohort.

DESIGN

Monocentric, prospective, non-randomized trial.

SETTING

University hospital in France.

PATIENTS

19 patients with XLHR and a mutation in the PHEX gene. Six male and 6 female Tanner stage 1 patients (age 6.1$\pm$2.4years) and 4 male and 3 female Tanner stage 2 patients (age 13.1$\pm$1years). At inclusion, height SDS was -2.35$\pm$0.8 SDS and growth velocity was -1.12$\pm$1.2 SDS.

INTERVENTION

2years of treatment with 67mcg/kg/day of rhGH at initiation. Every three months rhGH dosage was adjusted using an IGF-1 dosing protocol.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Comparison in change from baseline to year 2 in height and growth velocity.

RESULTS

Height SDS improved from -2.35$\pm$0.8 SDS at baseline, to -1.62$\pm$0.8 SDS (p=0.01) after one and to -1.2$\pm$1 SDS (p=0.04) after two years of rhGH treatment. There was a strong correlation (r(2)=0.6104, p{\textless}0.0001) between the age of onset of rhGH treatment and the number of cm gained over the study period. Pre-pubertal patients height SDS improved compared to baseline height SDS after one (-1.5$\pm$0.7, p{\textless}0.03) and two (-0.96$\pm$1, p{\textless}0.03) years of rhGH treatment. In pubertal patients there was no significant improvement in height SDS after one year (-1.75$\pm$1) and after two years (-1.7$\pm$0.8) of rhGH treatment.

CONCLUSION

Two-year rhGH treatment is effective to treat short stature in XLHR children. Pre-pubertal children responded better to rhGH.

We report a case of tumor-induced osteomalacia with evidence of synchronous multifocal fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) production.

OBJECTIVE

The aim is to present a case of tumor-induced osteomalacia and to highlight the fact that incomplete removal of multifocal FGF23-producing tumors, which are not entirely picked up by functional imaging, could be the cause of treatment failure.

SETTING

The patient was treated in the Department of Endocrinology of a tertiary care center in India.

PATIENT

We report the case of a 42-year-old male with tumor-induced osteomalacia.

INTERVENTION

We treated the tumor-induced osteomalacia with staged surgery of the two tumors. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesion (considered the sole culprit lesion after functional imaging) was resected first, followed by the non-FDG-avid lesion. The sequential removal of both tumors resulted in complete cure.

RESULTS

The patient had hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphaturia. C-Terminal FGF23 level was elevated. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed two lesions-an FDG-avid lesion in the right leg, and a non-avid lesion in the left thigh. After removal of the FDG-avid lesion, the hypophosphatemia persisted, and the FGF23 level showed only modest reduction. The patient had complete clinical and biochemical resolution only after removal of the second non-FDG-avid tumor.

CONCLUSIONS

We present the case of a tumor-induced osteomalacia whose biochemical parameters did not improve after removal of the FDG-avid tumor initially. The possibility of multifocal FGF23 production was considered, and the second, non-FDG-avid lesion was resected, which resulted in complete cure. Thorough clinical examination and meticulous follow-up with documentation of the biochemical resolution are necessary for management of all patients with this rare disorder.},

Animal studies suggest that hypophosphatemic rickets (HPR) is associated with muscle function deficits, but it is unknown whether humans with HPR have a muscle disorder.

OBJECTIVE

Our objective was to assess calf muscle size and density (an indicator of muscle quality) and lower extremity muscle function in patients with HPR.

SETTING

The study was carried out in the outpatient department of a pediatric orthopedic hospital.

PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS

Participants included 34 individuals with HPR (6-60 yr; nine males) and 34 age- and gender-matched controls.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Calf muscle parameters (muscle cross-sectional area and density) were measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Lower extremity muscle function (peak force per body weight and peak power per body mass) was measured by jumping mechanography through five tests with different levels of difficulty: multiple two-legged hopping, multiple one-legged hopping, single two-legged jump, chair-rise test, and heel-rise test.

RESULTS

Compared with age- and gender-matched controls, patients with HPR had normal muscle size (P = 0.58) but lower muscle density (P = 0.008) and lower peak muscle force and power (P {\textless} 0.001 in each test). Muscle function tests were also lower in the subgroup of patients with straight legs (n = 13) than in controls, even though patients with straight legs had higher muscle function test results than patients with severe leg deformities.

CONCLUSIONS

The present study suggests that muscle weakness is a clinical feature of HPR. Lower muscle quality and limb deformities contribute to this functional deficit.},

We recently found that patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) have a muscle function deficit in the lower extremities. As muscle force and bone mass are usually closely related, we hypothesized that patients with XLH could also have a bone mass deficit in the lower extremities.

OBJECTIVE

The study objective was to assess the muscle-bone relationship in the lower extremities of patients with XLH.

SETTING

The study was carried out in the outpatients department of a pediatric orthopedic hospital.

PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS

Thirty individuals with XLH (6 to 60 y; 9 male patients) and 30 age- and gender-matched controls participated.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Calf muscle size and density as well as tibia bone mass and geometry were assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Muscle function was evaluated as peak force in the multiple 2-legged hopping test.

RESULTS

Muscle force was significantly lower in XLH patients than in controls but muscle cross-sectional area did not differ (after adjustment for tibia length). External bone size, expressed as total bone cross-sectional area, was higher in the XLH group than in controls. The XLH cohort also had statistically significantly higher bone mineral content.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with XLH have increased bone mass and size at the distal tibia despite muscle function deficits.},

Localization of phosphatonin-producing mesenchymal tumours in patients with primary tumour-induced osteomalacia (pTIO) is challenging. Functional imaging plays an important role in the localization of these tumours.

OBJECTIVE

We studied the relative performance of different functional imaging modalities ((18) F-FDG PET/CT, (99) Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT and (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT) in tumour localization in cases of pTIO.

DESIGN AND METHODS

Retrospective chart evaluation of 16 patients with confirmed TIO treated from 2006 to 2013 was conducted in a tertiary care referral centre.

RESULTS

Of 16, nine patients had pTIO. In these nine, the positivity rates of different functional imaging modalities were 50{\%} for (18) F-FDG PET/CT (four of eight patients), 100{\%} for (99) Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT (six of six patients) and 100{\%} for (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT (seven of seven patients). Of nine patients, six were subjected to both the (99) Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT and (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and all of them showed coregistration on the two scans.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with pTIO, the somatostatin receptor-based functional scans performed better than (18) F-FDG PET/CT in tumour localization. Amongst the somatostatin receptor-based scans, (99) Tc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT/CT and (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT performed equally well for localization of tumours.},

Three primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia exist: increased renal excretion, decreased intestinal absorption, and shifts from the extracellular to intracellular compartments. Renal hypophosphatemia can be further divided into fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated or non-fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated causes. Proper diagnosis requires a thorough medication history, family history, physical examination, and assessment of renal tubular phosphate handling to identify the cause. During the past decade, our understanding of phosphate metabolism has grown greatly through the study of rare disorders of phosphate homeostasis. Treatment of hypophosphatemia depends on the underlying disorder and requires close biochemical monitoring.

It is generally caused by a lack of mineral supply, which can either occur as a result of the deficiency of calcium (calciopaenic rickets, now known as parathyroid hormone-dependent rickets) or of phosphate (phosphopaenic rickets, now called FGF23-dependent rickets). Renal disorders may also interfere with the process of mineralisation and cause rickets. Only parathyroid hormone-dependent rickets and distal renal tubular disorders will be discussed in this chapter. The most common cause of rickets is still vitamin D deficiency, which is also responsible for other problems. Disorders of vitamin D metabolism or responsiveness may also cause similar issues. Distal renal tubular acidosis may also be caused by a variety of metabolic errors similar to those of osteoclasts. One form of distal renal tubular acidosis also causes a type of osteopetrosis.

 abstract = {Studies in the last decade demonstrated that in children tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) is identical to TP/GFR; TP indicating tubular phosphate reabsorption under basal conditions, without phosphate load. TP/GFR is calculated from the formula TP/GFR = SP-UP x SCr:UCr, based on simultaneous urine and blood creatinine and phosphate concentrations, and is applicable in both the fasting and non-fasting child. These studies also demonstrated that the use of Walton and Bijvoet nomogram in children may result in overestimation of TmP/GFR compared with TP/GFR calculated from the above formula. When using the formula, one should bear in mind that creatinine is used to express GFR and as a result a significant deviation from true GFR may occur in patients with renal failure. Therefore when employing TP/GFR for the investigation of the renal handling of phosphate in children, three factors should be taken into consideration: (1) the formula in reality expresses TP/CCr; (2) only data obtained by exactly the same methodology can be used as reference values; data obtained from studies in which the nomogram was utilized or in which methods other than CCr were used to measure GFR should not be used for reference; (3) in patients with renal failure, TP/CCr will significantly overestimate TP/Cinulin.},

 abstract = {Optimal cellular function is dependent on maintenance of a normal serum phosphorus concentration. Serum phosphorus concentration is affected by several determinants, the most important of which is regulation of phosphorus reabsorption by the kidney. The majority of this reabsorption (80{\%}) occurs in the proximal tubule and is mediated by an isoform of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-II). Parathyroid hormone, via a variety of intracellular signaling cascades leading to NaPi-IIa internalization and downregulation, is the main regulator of renal phosphate reabsorption. Shift of phosphorus from extracellular to intracellular compartments, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and increased urinary losses, are the primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia, which affects approximately 2{\%} of hospitalized patients. Hypophosphatemia has been implicated as a cause of rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, hemolysis and left ventricular dysfunction. With the exception of ventilated patients, there is little evidence that moderate hypophosphatemia has significant clinical consequences in humans, and aggressive intravenous phosphate replacement is unnecessary. By contrast, patients with severe hypophosphatemia should be treated. Intravenous repletion may be considered, especially for patients who have clinical sequelae of hypophosphatemia.},

 abstract = {Hypophosphatemia is defined as a serum phosphate level of less than 2.5 mg/dL (0.8 mmol/L). Hypophosphatemia is caused by inadequate intake, decreased intestinal absorption, excessive urinary excretion, or a shift of phosphate from the extracellular to the intracellular compartments. Renal phosphate wasting can result from genetic or acquired renal disorders. Acquired renal phosphate wasting syndromes can result from vitamin D deficiency hyperparathyroidism, oncogenic osteomalecia, and Fanconi syndrome. Genetic disorders of renal hypophosphatemic disorders generally manifest in infancy and are usually transmitted as an X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia are nonspecific and most patients are asymptomatic. Severe hypophosphatemia may cause skeletal muscle weakness, myocardial dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and altered mental status. The diagnostic approach to hypophosphatemia should begin with the measurement of fractional phosphate excretion; if greater than 15{\%} in the presence of hypophosphatemia, the diagnosis of renal phosphate wasting is confirmed. Renal phosphate wasting can be divided into 3 types based upon serum calcium levels: primary hyperparathyroidism (high serum calcium level), secondary hyperparathyroidism (low serum calcium level), and primary renal phosphate wasting (normal serum calcium level). Phosphate supplementations are indicated in patients who are symptomatic or who have a renal tubular defect leading to chronic phosphate wasting. Oral phosphate supplements in combination with calcitriol are the mainstay of treatment. Parenteral phosphate supplementation is generally reserved for patient with life-threatening hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate {\textless} 2.0 mg/dL). Intravenous phosphate (0.16 mmol/kg) is administered at a rate of 1 mmol/h to 3 mmol/h until a level of 2 mg/dL is reached.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Renal phosphate-wasting disorders are the most common form of hereditary rickets and osteomalacia in western countries, but are rarely reported in India. Therefore, we report here a case of hypophosphatemic rickets.

AIM AND OBJECTIVE

To report a case of hypophosphatemic rickets presenting with recurrent pathological fractures.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

A 34-year-old premenopausal lady presented with recurrent pathological fractures, bone pain, and muscle weakness since 14 years of age. A thorough history was taken followed by clinical examination, and relevant biochemical and radiological investigations were done.

RESULTS

Height was 125 cm, arm span 145 cm, body weight 30 kg, and body mass index (BMI) 19.2 kg/m(2). Dental caries, kyphoscoliosis, shortening of left lower limb, bilateral coxa vara deformity of knee, muscle weakness, and bone tenderness were present. Calcium was 9.4 mg/dL, phosphorus: 1.8 mg/dL, albumin: 4.0 gm/dL, alkaline phosphatase: 360 U/L, creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL, a normal ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) loading test,24-hour urine calcium excretion: 102 mg/day, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]: 21.6 ng/mL, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH): 43.74 pg/mL, fraction excretion of phosphate (PO4): 40{\%}, tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per unit of glomerular filtrate (TmP/GFR): 0.65 mg/dL, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)23: 321.4 RU/mL. Skeletal X-rays showed multiple old fractures and pseudofractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole body showed no evidence of tumor. Fludeoxyglucose ((18)F)-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) computed tomography (CT) scan revealed metabolically active marrow with multiple areas of fracture and FDG-avid lesions in both lungs but no CT-based findings.

CONCLUSION

Hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia, possibly hereditary, is a rare cause of recurrent pathological fractures.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is an acquired hypophosphatemic metabolic bone disorder that can be cured by removing or ablating the offending tumor. However, when the tumor cannot be localized, lifelong therapy with oral phosphate and calcitriol or cinacalcet with close monitoring is required.

CASE REPORT

A 56-year-old man was diagnosed with TIO in 1990. Initial therapy consisted of oral phosphate and calcitriol with symptomatic and biochemical improvement and healing of osteomalacia. Eight years later, hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism developed, requiring subtotal parathyroidectomy with a transient increase in serum phosphate and normalization of serum calcium and PTH. Recurrent hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism developed after 10 years of medical therapy. A deliberate total parathyroidectomy produced a prompt rise in serum phosphate into the normal range {\textgreater} 3.0 mg/dL and remained normal during the next 4 years of follow-up, despite continued very high serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels throughout the 23-year follow-up.

CONCLUSION

We report an unusual case of a TIO patient with long-term follow-up who developed recurrent hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism on long-term oral phosphate therapy. Deliberate total parathyroidectomy normalized serum phosphate despite persistently elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 levels. Total parathyroidectomy offers a potentially novel therapy in some patients with TIO in whom medical therapy is not feasible or the tumor is unresectable.},

Hypophosphatemic rickets (HR) is a rare disease that includes a group of hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by renal phosphate loss associated with normal to low vitamin D serum concentration. The most common form is the X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, with an incidence of 1:20,000. Several mutations have recently been identified in the PHEX, FGF23, DMP1 and ENPP1 genes in patients with HR. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies suggested an involvement of MEPE for defective mineralization in HR.

OBJECTIVE

The present case series describes the clinical features and the analysis of genes implicated in HR in a cohort of 26 Italian HR patients.

SETTING AND DESIGN

All patients were analyzed for the PHEX and FGF23 genes by direct sequencing. When no mutations were detected, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis was performed. The negative patients were screened for the DMP1, MEPE and ENPP1 genes by direct sequencing.

RESULTS

Twenty-two patients (84{\%}) harbored mutations in the PHEX gene. In particular, we detected 19 different mutations, 15 of which were novel. One patient presented a novel splice variation in the ENPP1 gene while no alterations were identified in the FGF23, DMP1 and MEPE genes. The genetic study of the families showed that 11 patients (55{\%}) had de novo mutations. Clinical presentation and disease severity did not show an evident correlation between the mutation types.

CONCLUSIONS

This report represents the first large familial study performed on Italian patients. It confirms that mutations in PHEX are the most frequent cause of HR. Furthermore, the variety of clinical manifestations identified in our HR patients underlines the extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity of this disease.},

@article{Chang.2016,
 abstract = {Metabolic bone diseases are a diverse group of diseases that result in abnormalities of (a) bone mass, (b) structure mineral homeostasis, (c) bone turnover, or (d) growth. Osteoporosis, the most common metabolic bone disease, results in generalized loss of bone mass and deterioration in the bone microarchitecture. Impaired chondrocyte development and failure to mineralize growth plate cartilage in rickets lead to widened growth plates and frayed metaphyses at sites of greatest growth. Osteomalacia is the result of impaired mineralization of newly formed osteoid, which leads to characteristic Looser zones. Hypophosphatasia is a congenital condition of impaired bone mineralization with wide phenotypic variability. Findings of hyperparathyroidism are the result of bone resorption, most often manifesting as subperiosteal resorption in the hand. Renal osteodystrophy is the collection of skeletal findings observed in patients with chronic renal failure and associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and can include osteopenia, osteosclerosis, and {\dq}rugger jersey spine.{\dq} Hypoparathyroidism is most commonly due to iatrogenic injury, and radiographic findings of hypoparathyroidism reflect an overall increase in bone mass. Thyroid hormone regulates endochondral bone formation; and congenital hypothyroidism, when untreated, leads to delayed bone age and absent, irregular, or fragmented distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Soft-tissue proliferation of thyroid acropachy is most often observed in the hands and feet. The findings of acromegaly are due to excess growth hormone secretion and therefore proliferation of the bones and soft tissues. Vitamin C deficiency, or scurvy, impairs posttranslational collagen modification, leading to subperiosteal hemorrhage and fractures. ({\copyright})RSNA, 2016.},

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by mutations in PHEX. Even though the disease is characterized by disordered skeletal mineralization, detailed bone densitometric studies are lacking.

OBJECTIVE

The aim of the study was to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets using forearm peripheral quantitative computed tomography.

SETTING

The study was conducted in the metabolic bone clinic of a pediatric orthopedic hospital.

PATIENTS

Thirty-four patients (age, 6 to 60 years; 24 female) with PHEX mutations were studied, of whom 7 children (age, 6 to 11 years) were actively being treated with calcitriol and phosphate supplementation. Twenty-one patients (age, 16 to 40 years) had received the same therapy before but had discontinued the treatment; 6 patients (age, 12 to 60 years) had never received this treatment.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Trabecular and cortical vBMD of the radius.

RESULTS

Trabecular vBMD was elevated (mean age-specific and sex-specific z-score: +1.0) when all patients were analyzed together, due to very high results in currently treated patients (mean z-score: +2.4) and slightly above-average mean values in the other patients. Cortical vBMD was low when the entire cohort was analyzed together (mean z-score: -3.3), but was higher in currently treated patients (mean z-score: -1.3) than in patients who had discontinued therapy (mean z-score: -3.8) or who had never been treated (mean z-score: -4.1).

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with PHEX mutations have elevated trabecular vBMD at the distal radius while receiving calcitriol and phosphate supplementation, but low cortical vBMD at the radius diaphysis. Low cortical vBMD presumably reflects the underlying mineralization defect that is not entirely corrected by current treatment approaches.},

@article{ColaresNeto.2017,
 abstract = {In X-linked hypophosphatemic (XLH) rickets, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements must be analyzed with caution. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) analysis suggested that XLH primarily affects the cancellous compartment, with the tibia more affected than the radius. Effective treatment of XLH appears to positively affect bone mineralization, mainly in the bone cortex.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this study is to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture in 37 patients (13 children and 24 adults) with XLH confirmed by PHEX mutations from a tertiary center compared to healthy controls.

METHODS

Areal BMD (aBMD) was evaluated by DXA, whereas volumetric BMD (vBMD) and microarchitectural parameters were analyzed by HR-pQCT.

RESULTS

Adult XLH patients had higher lumbar aBMD (p~{\textless}~0.01) than the controls. At the radius, the vBMD was similar between XLH patients and controls. At the tibia, XLH patients had lower total vBMD (p~=~0.04), likely resulting from decreased trabecular vBMD (p~{\textless}~0.01), and this difference was observed in the children and adult groups. Analysis based on metabolic status showed that the adult XLH patients with non-compensated disease had lower cortical vBMD at the tibia than the compensated XLH patients (p~=~0.03). The microarchitectural differences at the radius and tibia included lower trabecular number (p~{\textless}~0.01), greater trabecular separation (p~{\textless}~0.01), and higher trabecular network inhomogeneity (p~{\textless}~0.01) in XLH patients compared to their controls. At the radius, adults exhibited greater trabecular deficits than were seen in children.

CONCLUSIONS

In XLH patients, DXA measurements must be analyzed with caution due to the interference of anatomic and anthropometric factors. HR-pQCT analysis suggested that XLH primarily affects the cancellous compartment, with the tibia more affected than the radius. Effective treatment of XLH appears to positively affect bone mineralization, mainly in the bone cortex.},

 abstract = {Hypophosphatemia can be acute or chronic. Acute hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion is common in the hospital setting and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Chronic hypophosphatemia, often associated with genetic or acquired renal phosphate-wasting disorders, usually produces abnormal growth and rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Acute hypophosphatemia may be mild (phosphorus level, 2-2.5 mg/dL), moderate (1-1.9 mg/dL), or severe ({\textless}1 mg/dL) and commonly occurs in clinical settings such as refeeding, alcoholism, diabetic ketoacidosis, malnutrition/starvation, and after surgery (particularly after partial hepatectomy) and in the intensive care unit. Phosphate replacement can be given either orally, intravenously, intradialytically, or in total parenteral nutrition solutions. The rate and amount of replacement are empirically determined, and several algorithms are available. Treatment is tailored to symptoms, severity, anticipated duration of illness, and presence of comorbid conditions, such as kidney failure, volume overload, hypo- or hypercalcemia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, and acid-base status. Mild/moderate acute hypophosphatemia usually can be corrected with increased dietary phosphate or oral supplementation, but intravenous replacement generally is needed when significant comorbid conditions or severe hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion exist. In chronic hypophosphatemia, standard treatment includes oral phosphate supplementation and active vitamin D. Future treatment for specific disorders associated with chronic hypophosphatemia may include cinacalcet, calcitonin, or dypyrimadole.},

@article{Geerse.2010,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Currently no evidence-based guideline exists for the approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

METHODS

We performed a narrative review of the medical literature to identify the incidence, symptoms, and treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients. Specifically, we searched for answers to the questions whether correction of hypophosphatemia is associated with improved outcome, and whether a certain treatment strategy is superior.

RESULTS

Incidence: hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered in the intensive care unit; and critically ill patients are at increased risk for developing hypophosphatemia due to the presence of multiple causal factors.

SYMPTOMS

hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, including cardiac and respiratory failure.

TREATMENT

hypophosphatemia is generally corrected when it is symptomatic or severe. However, although multiple studies confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate administration, it remains uncertain when and how to correct hypophosphatemia.

OUTCOME

in some studies, hypophosphatemia was associated with higher mortality; a paucity of randomized controlled evidence exists for whether correction of hypophosphatemia improves the outcome in critically ill patients.

CONCLUSIONS

Additional studies addressing the current approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients are required. Studies should focus on the association between hypophosphatemia and morbidity and/or mortality, as well as the effect of correction of this electrolyte disorder.},

 abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) regulates phosphate reabsorption in the kidney and therefore plays an essential role in phosphate balance in humans. There is a host of defects that ultimately lead to excess FGF23 levels and thereby cause renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemic rickets. We describe the genetic, pathophysiologic, and clinical aspects of this group of disorders with a focus on X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), the best characterized of these abnormalities. We also discuss autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) in addition to other rarer FGF23-mediated conditions. We contrast the FGF23-mediated disorders with FGF23-independent hypophosphatemia, specifically hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). Errant diagnosis of hypophosphatemic disorders is common. This review aims to enhance the recognition and appropriate diagnosis of hypophosphatemia and to guide appropriate treatment.},

Disruption of any point in the pathways of phosphate metabolism may cause serum phosphate abnormalities and resultant acute or chronic clinical conditions. The study of phosphate disorders has revealed a wealth of information regarding normal phosphate physiology. Careful evaluation of affected patients based on pathophysiologic assessments will usually identify the aetiology of hypophosphataemia or hyperphosphataemia, which is important to guide appropriate therapy. Because of the relative importance of chronic hypophosphataemia and hyperphosphataemia to bone disease, much of this chapter will focus on chronic disorders, especially those mediated by excess or deficient fibroblast growth factor 23 functioning.},

@article{Wohrle.2013,
 abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a circulating factor secreted by osteocytes that is essential for phosphate homeostasis. In kidney proximal tubular cells FGF23 inhibits phosphate reabsorption and leads to decreased synthesis and enhanced catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2 D3 ). Excess levels of FGF23 cause renal phosphate wasting and suppression of circulating 1,25(OH)2 D3 levels and are associated with several hereditary hypophosphatemic disorders with skeletal abnormalities, including X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR). Currently, therapeutic approaches to these diseases are limited to treatment with activated vitamin D analogues and phosphate supplementation, often merely resulting in partial correction of the skeletal aberrations. In this study, we evaluate the use of FGFR inhibitors for the treatment of FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic disorders using NVP-BGJ398, a novel selective, pan-specific FGFR inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trials for cancer therapy. In two different hypophosphatemic mouse models, Hyp and Dmp1-null mice, resembling the human diseases XLH and ARHR, we find that pharmacological inhibition of FGFRs efficiently abrogates aberrant FGF23 signaling and normalizes the hypophosphatemic and hypocalcemic conditions of these mice. Correspondingly, long-term FGFR inhibition in Hyp mice leads to enhanced bone growth, increased mineralization, and reorganization of the disturbed growth plate structure. We therefore propose NVP-BGJ398 treatment as a novel approach for the therapy of FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemic diseases.},
